  - Quick conclusions
    - Device Spec: 
      - Cortex-A – microprocessors, intended mainly for operating systems, e.g. Linux, Android, Windows CE, iOS. They require external systems to work.
      - Cortex-R – circuits intended for real-time systems.
      - Cortex-M – microcontrollers, i.e. systems that have integrated memory and peripheral systems.
      - 3 × SPI, 1 × QSPI, 3 × I2C, 1 × CAN, 5 × USART, 1 × ULP UART,
      - 16 timers,
      - 3 × 12-bits ADC (24 internal canals ADC),
      - 51 × GPIO,
      - 2 × analog comparators,
      - 2 × operational amplifiers,
      - 1 × NTC,
      - DMA (direct memory access),
      - TRNG (true random number generator),
      - FPU (floating-point unit),
      - 1Mb Flash
      - 128 Kb RAM (96 Kb RAM & 32 Kb RAM2.)
    - Code only between `/* USER CODE BEGIN 1 */` & `/* USER CODE END 1 */` -CubeMX overwrites other code when changing configurartion
